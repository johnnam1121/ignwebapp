Video player webapp created by John Nam for IGN's Code Foo 10 internship

Features:

1. Checks if user is not restricted by CORS policy (IGN employees?) by using "https://ign-apis.herokuapp.com/videos" and immediately shows webpage. If user is restricted by CORS policy, shows button to redirect to CORS demo page to allow temporary access then uses the url "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://ign-apis.herokuapp.com/videos".
2. Main video player made using the component "React Player" which comes with controls. 
3. Main video is shown along with title, description, and tags.
3. OnEnded handler checks to see if video is done playing. If so, play next video.
4. OnVideoSelected handler checks if video on suggestions list is clicked. If so, play that specific video.
5. OnHover makes the suggested videos scale a little for better user interface
6. Accordion added on bottom of suggested videos list to load more items.
